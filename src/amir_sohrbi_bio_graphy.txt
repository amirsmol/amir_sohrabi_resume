Amir Sohrabi is a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering Department of Texas A&M University.
He has a Master of Science degree in Aero Structural Engineering from Amir Kabir University of Technology.
His undergraduate study was on Mechanical Engineering and in Fluid and heats.
He undergraduate and graduate research was on robotics and laminated composite plates respectively.
At the moment, he is working on his dissertation on Nonlinear and Rate-Dependent Hysteresis Electro-Mechanical Responses of Ferro-Electric Materials.
He has developed his own finite element model for using Fortran90 for solving problems in solid mechanics.
This model enables non linear and time dependent simulation of multi functional structures.
His area of interest are in:
	Finite Element Method
	Piezo electric materials
	Nonlinear material models and nonlinear geometry
	Robotics
